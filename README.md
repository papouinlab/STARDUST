STARDUST: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Regional Dynamics &amp; Unbiased Sorting of Transients

![STARDUST workflow](workflow.png)

STARDUST is a python-based pipeline that captures Ca2+ dynamics in confined, local micro-domains across the territory of all astrocytes within the field of view. STARDUST builds upon [AQuA](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA/), a popular open-source fluorescence analysis platform11, to yield maps of regions of activity (ROAs) from patches of active signals, which can be combined with cell-segmentation and/or correlated to cellular morphology. Importantly, STARDUST makes no assumption regarding Ca2+ propagation across ROAs, in line with the seemingly static nature of astrocyte Ca2+ activity. Instead, STARDUST treats ROAs as independent units and focuses on decomposing Ca2+ dynamics in a regionalized fashion, yielding as many as 100 ROAs per cell, or thousands across the field of view, and extracting fluorescence time-series, signals and signal features from each of them. A particular instantiation of the usefulness of STARDUST is in pharmacology experiments, where it can distinguish “stable ROAs” (active throughout the recording), from “ON ROAs” (inactive at baseline and turned on during drug application), and “OFF ROAs” (active at baseline and turned off during drug application). Together, this makes STARDUST a user-friendly complement or alternative to the small number of publicly available algorithms and tools recently developed to tackle astrocyte Ca2+ activity.
